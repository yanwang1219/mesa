    A collection class that represents an ordered set of agents within an agent-based model (ABM). This class
    extends both MutableSet and Sequence, providing set-like functionality with order preservation and
    sequence operations.

    Attributes:
        model (Model): The ABM model instance to which this AgentSet belongs.

    Methods:
        __len__, __iter__, __contains__, select, shuffle, sort, _update, do, get, __getitem__,
        add, discard, remove, __getstate__, __setstate__, random

    Note:
        The AgentSet maintains weak references to agents, allowing for efficient management of agent lifecycles
        without preventing garbage collection. It is associated with a specific model instance, enabling
        interactions with the model's environment and other agents.The implementation uses a WeakKeyDictionary to store agents,
        which means that agents not referenced elsewhere in the program may be automatically removed from the AgentSet.
